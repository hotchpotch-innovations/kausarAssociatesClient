In this venture, the parties typically share ownership, control, and profits based on the terms outlined in an agrement. Joint ventures can be formed betwen domestic and foreign companies. They are often used as a means of entering new markets, accessing new  technology or expertise, and sharing risks and costs. In Bangladesh, joint ventures are regulated by the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA). Companies must comply with the regulations and procedures outlined by the authority to establish and operate a joint venture.",
      "A joint venture is a combination of two or more parties who strive for the development of a single enterprise or project for profit, sharing the risks associated with its development. The joint venture must involve at least two individuals or entities. Not all sectors are open to 100% foreign investment. In those sectors, foreign investors cannot operate by opening Branch Offices as they usually do. One hundred percent (100%) Foreign investment is not permitted in the sectors of Arms and ammunition, Production of nuclear energy, Security planning, and Forest plantation. That doesn't mean that they can't do business in other ways. The government of Bangladesh allows foreign investors to do business in this country by allowing them to invest in the Joint Venture Company.",
      "In a Joint Venture company, local and foreign investors come together to establish a Joint Venture Company and follow the rules and regulations that are required by the law. One important point to be noted is that, when it comes to foreign investment, if the Joint Venture Company wishes to offer freight forwarding services then foreign shareholders cannot own more than 40% of shares. Only 60% of local shareholding and the highest 40% of foreign shareholding is allowed in the Joint Venture Company to incorporate a JV Logistics Company, which is a pre-requirement for obtaining a Freight forwarding license. Single or multiple foreign investors are allowed to invest in a single project as long as there are one or more local investors."
